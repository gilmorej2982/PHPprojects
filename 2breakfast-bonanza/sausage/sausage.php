Lorne sausage is a Scottish    food and can be found everywhere in Scotland. It is an uncased sausage made    of a mixture of beef and pork, bolstered with rusk, and seasoned with coriander    and nutmeg. The meat is formed into loaves and then sliced.</p>    <p>When I lived in Scotland, I most often bought rolls filled with slices      of square sausage from the café next to the office I worked at in Glasgow      (sometimes they would run out of rolls and serve it on baguette), or sometimes      I would buy a Styrofoam tray of fry-up meats–slices of Lorne sausage, some      black pudding, and some fruit pudding–from the supermarket and have that      on a weekend morning with some fried eggs and maybe a couple of slices      of bacon, some sautéed mushrooms, and fried tomato. For all of its ubiquity      there, I’ve never seen this type of sausage outside of Scotland.</p>    <p>Even though I can’t buy Lorne sausage here, it’s really one of the easiest      sausages to make, and I whipped up a batch this weekend. I bought whole      cuts of meat and ground them myself, but you can just as easily make this      with pre-ground meat as long as it is fatty enough. There do seem to be      plenty of variations on the recipe, though I made what seems to be a fairly      basic one. I found mention that some versions of Lorne sausage use “a couple      of fingers” of whisky as an aspect of the seasoning, and while I’m sure      that this would be delicious, it’s a little more refined than I would generally      like for a breakfast food. I used breadcrumbs for this recipe, but I’ve      seen some recipes calling for oats instead and I would like to try that    the next time I make a batch of sausage.</p>    <p>This is a nice, slightly sweet, robustly-flavoured sausage that is great      for starting off the day. For me, it has more than a touch of nostalgic      appeal as well: there are some things like a certain kind of light on an      otherwise damp and grey day, the complex aromatics of a glass of whisky,      and yes, the taste of coriander and nutmeg, that really make me miss the    couple of years I spent in Scotland and the friends I made there.</p></article><aside id="sidebar"><!-- include sidebar here --><?php get_sidebar(); ?></aside><footer id="colophon"><!-- include footer here --><?php get_footer(); ?></footer></div></body></html>
