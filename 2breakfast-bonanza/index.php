<h2>Beautiful Breakfast Stories</h2>
 <p>The rigours of the army had instilled immaculate lifestyle discipline in Major Anil, of which he was understandably proud.</p>
  <p>Even after he retired, he would be up at five in the morning to breathe the dewy air, do his suryanamaskar and water the plants. Amit, his son, my pal, was a smart youngster and an avid bird watcher, whose body clock was, funnily, wired completely opposite to his father's! Amit's waking hours matched those of the collared scops owl, and the major's mission was to re-wire his son!</p>
  <p>Whenever Amit and I returned home from our late night jaunts, uncle would be there to welcome us and enquire how our day was. But like I said, he would beat the clock by the second and be up at five for he had a wayward son to wake. &quot;Wake up Amit,&quot; he would say. Amit would pull a pillow over his ears, uncle would yank it off, &quot;wake up — it's morning&quot;, Amit's hand would rove around and pull whatever it found over his head: the jeans that he had flung next to the bed, sometimes even the bedsheet on which he was sleeping! Those were yanked off as well, and the windows opened to let the cold air in, then Amit would start negotiating for time.</p>
  <p>&quot;Five more minutes please!&quot; Uncle would count the seconds down. On occasion, it wasn't beyond uncle to pour a mug of water over Amit!</p>
  <p>This was almost a daily ritual but by half past five — the whole family would be up! Uncle, happy that he had made progress, making mental notes that he had only thirty more minutes to chip off, Amit and I, with sleep deprived heads, would invariably find ourselves watering the plants or washing the car!</p>
  <p>The pain of getting up early, however, came to nought, when Aunty Sunila would call us all to the table. Her mastery of the breakfast was what folklores are made of: fluffy poha, crisp but melt in the mouth aloo paranthas or namak ajwain ki roti with dollops of soft melting butter and chilled maa ki daal, homemade gajar gobhi shalgam achar (carrot, cauliflower, turnip pickle), thick cumin lassi, incredibly ballooned puris with a potato rassa, an ate ka halwa (whole wheat pudding) that would bring us to our knees and a devastatingly good but secret recipe of creamed onions and tomatoes!</p>
  <p>Discipline was easily installed by uncle with a little help from his culinary wizard wife. It paid to be up at five in the morning!</p>
  <p>PS: Last month we visited Amit at his beautiful home in Trivandrum. Amit and I were up waking our kids while our wives were busy with the paranthas. We knew, in an instant, as long as there was breakfast on the table, all was well with the world.</p>
