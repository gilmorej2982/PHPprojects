As the panelists arrived    for the tasting, their eyes lit up in anticipation, ready for the challenge    ahead.</p>  <p>Fifteen brands later, their stomachs weren't as thrilled.</p>  <p>It may have been overkill, but a trip through any supermarket reveals that    for every brand of bacon on the market these days, there seems to be a &quot;thick&quot; counterpart.</p>  <p>Since our common denominator was the thickness of the bacon (each of these    was at least 1/8-inch thick), the other characteristics varied from brand    to brand. Some were center cut, some uncured, some salt cured and some with    a hint of extra smoke.</p>  <p>Bacon lovers have different ideas when it comes to cooking methods. Many    prefer strips so crisp they could snap in half, while others want to chew    the fat. To ensure that the tasters all received hot, fully cooked bacon    that was both chewy and slightly crunchy, we started it raw in cold pans    and cooked the bacon until it was almost done, finishing it in the oven to    give it a final blast of heat.</p></article><aside id="sidebar"><!-- include sidebar here --><?php get_sidebar(); ?></aside><footer id="colophon"><!-- include footer here --><?php get_footer(); ?></footer></div></body></html>
