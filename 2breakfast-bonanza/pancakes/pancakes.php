The Bay Harbor version - extremely busy especially      on weekend mornings - features a locally-evolving menu and a theme that melds      perfectly with Bay Harbor’s overall feel.</p>      <p>“Frank Hamilton would be responsible for the look,” Barrett says, “and I      believe it was his wife Anika that found a lot of the items that are here.      I would have to say it is a modern industrial nautical theme.”</p>      By “modern industrial nautical,” Barrett is attempting to describe The Original      Pancake House’s unique look; not overly boat-focused, but not too “city-fied”      for Up North folk. the decor blends a smooth tile floor and a few nautical      collectibles such as buoys and lights along with super-high ceilings, big      windows, and huge air-intake tubes running across the ceiling to add a “renovated-factory”      feel, in spite of the fact that the building is newer construction.         </p></article><aside id="sidebar"><!-- include sidebar here --><?php get_sidebar(); ?></aside><footer id="colophon"><!-- include footer here --><?php get_footer(); ?></footer></div></body></html>
