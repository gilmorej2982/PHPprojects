FOR YOUR PHP DEMOS

1. upload the demo directory to your remote host. I recommend making a php folder on the host, and then putting all the demos inside it.

example url to a demo page:

http://www.yourhost.com/php/php_intro/demo.php

(note that this is not a real functioning url) :-)

2. view live demo page in browser

3. make any changes or create code locally

4. upload new page

5. refresh page in broswer

*** REMEMBER - YOUR PAGES WON'T PARSE LOCALLY!! ***
