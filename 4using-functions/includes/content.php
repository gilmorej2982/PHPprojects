<?php echo '<p>the following content is the include file that you brought in with an external function.</p>'; ?>
<p>It's useful to be able to write functions for tasks that will happen on multiple pages, like calling include files to the page (banners, footers, etc). This paragraph is displaying because you have written a function on an external <code>functions.php</code> page in a scripts directory, and included it in your page. Remember that a function must be defined before it can be called, so including your functions page at the top of your page (before the DOCTYPE declaration) is a good idea, particularly if you have functions that are used to put information into the head of your page (as in the title tag and whatnot). If you call your function for the title before the functions page has been included, you'll get an error.
