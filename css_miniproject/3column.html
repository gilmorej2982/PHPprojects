The public housing  project is seen as one of the worst examples of urban planning in the country.  It concentrated poor, mostly African American residents in substandard high-rise  apartments and row houses. Cabrini-Green gained a national reputation for organized  crime, gang violence and drug activity.</p><p>When she was 4 years old, Van Leer left Cabrini-Green with her mother and  six brothers and sisters and moved to the Riverwest area of Milwaukee. Now,  the 22-year-old is studying architecture at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee  (UWM). Van Leer says growing up in urban communities helped shape her career  goals.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in issues affecting low-income people,&rdquo; Van  Leer said. &ldquo;I want to bring more awareness to the concerns they face.  And I can add a personal view of that environment.&rdquo;</p><p>Van Leer and her older sister are first-generation college students.</p><p>&ldquo;Education was not a topic of discussion in our household,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;But I had a lot of teachers who saw a lot in me and encouraged  me to go into higher education. They showed me I had potential in something.&rdquo;</p><p>Van Leer is one of the UWM&rsquo;s McNair Scholars. The goal of the federal  program is to boost the number of students from underrepresented backgrounds  who enter graduate school. The program was established in 1989 in honor of  Ronald E. McNair, who was the second African American to fly in space. He died  in the space shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986.</p><p>Each year, at least two-thirds of the McNair Scholars are low-income, first-generation  college students. The remaining students come from backgrounds that are underrepresented  in graduate education. The McNair Program provides students academic advising,  tutoring, career counseling and travel opportunities to help make a smooth  transition from undergraduate to graduate education. The program is open to  all students in all fields of study.</p><p>This year, Van Leer and two other McNair Scholars are studying architecture,  a degree program that typically sees low minority enrollment.<br />  Catherine Van Leer and her faculty mentor, Sammis White, professor of urban  planning, in one of the studios in the School of Architecture and Urban Planning </p><p>&ldquo;Architecture inspires me to make my mark,&rdquo; Van Leer said. &ldquo;I  have a special interest in urban planning. I like the social and economic aspects  of cities &ndash; how architecture follows function. You have to think about  what function buildings have and what impact they create.&rdquo;</p><p>UW-Milwaukee McNair Scholars also produce research abstracts during the summer.  Van Leer&rsquo;s paper is titled &ldquo;Evaluating Strategies for Confronting  Inner-City Poverty: Increasing the Earned Income of Poor Residents.&rdquo; The  paper chronicles the history of economic troubles, poverty and joblessness  in Milwaukee.</p><p>Van Leer examines three strategies to revitalize poor city neighborhoods &ndash; the  dispersal of low-income families in higher-income suburban neighborhoods, the  redevelopment of inner-city neighborhoods using federal grants and private  investment, and efforts to provide transportation for low-income city workers  to get to jobs in the suburbs.</p><p>&ldquo;My goal is to be active in our community. I&rsquo;d like to work on  policy changes that can have a lasting impact,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Van Leer&rsquo;s mentor for the research project was Sammis White, a professor  of urban planning and the director of the Center for Workforce Development  at UWM. He said it&rsquo;s rare to find an undergraduate who wants to study  the issue of poverty.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very difficult issue to address,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  had many decades of federal public policy trying to do it, as well as many  local organizations trying to address it. And if we look at the numbers, as  Catherine did, things got a little better for a while, but they really haven&rsquo;t  changed much. In recent years, poverty has increased in Milwaukee and several  other major cities.&rdquo;</p><p>White says he&rsquo;s glad to see architecture and urban planning becoming  a more diverse field of study at UWM.</p><p>&ldquo;An awful lot of individuals pursue occupations they know something  about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are very few black architects and even  fewer black urban planners. It&rsquo;s been a major problem to try to get word  of these fields out to a broader audience.&rdquo;</p><p>Van Leer says she&rsquo;s considering UW-Milwaukee, Penn State or the University  of Illinois at Chicago for her graduate degree. She says she&rsquo;d like to  end up working in Milwaukee.</p><p>&ldquo;I see a lot of opportunities and a lot of potential in Milwaukee,&rdquo; she  said.</p><p>Other 2006 McNair Scholars&rsquo; summer research projects focused on breast-feeding  in the workplace, obstacles to prenatal care among African American adolescents,  the rise of contemporary Chinese art, analysis of late-night comedy news shows  and Hispanic/Latino involvement in K-12 education.</p></article><footer id="colophon">  <p>This is the Footer  </p></footer></div></body></html>
