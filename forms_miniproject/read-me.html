<h1>PHP & WordPress<br />
Forms Mini-Project: Retrieving and using form data <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">(15 pts)</span></h1>
<h3>Focus on:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creating a robust, usable form</li>
<li>Styling the form using CSS</li>
<li>Creating variables from the data sent via POST and using it in scripts</li>
<li>New PHP functions: <code>isset(), count(), implode()</code> and the <code>&&</code> and <code>! </code>operators. </li>
<li>Using conditional statements and loops.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Description Part I: the form</h3>
<p>You have been provided screenshots of a form: one is the unstyled appearance of the form, and the other is what it needs to look like after it is styled.</p>
<p>Create the form as described on miniproject-form.php. Check your unstyled form against the screenshot of the unstyled form, and then begin to style your form. Be sure you have all the correct attributes so that the form VALIDATES. You also need to be sure that you fill in the method and action attributes with the correct information.</p>
<p><strong>You can have any values for the favorite color and TV shows that you want; don't use mine.</strong></p> 

<h3>Hints</h3>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">The styled form in our checkboxes exercise has good information about how to mark up the form for styling.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">The CSS for that form gives good hints about how to approach styling a form. You can also visit the links on our D2L site.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">To validate a form that is .php, you need to EITHER copy and paste the markup into the validator, OR you need to save a copy of the file as a .html file. It won't parse any scripts (so don't use it for your mini-project), but the validator can't check a .php file. You'll need to choose one method to validate your form. (However, you can validate the CSS on a php document).</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Use your Forms notes, exercise and powerpoint for hints on writing forms. We've covered it all.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Description Part II: the script</h3>
<p>I took a screen shot of what the script processed from MY form. Use it as an example of what you are looking for. Again, you can use whatever colors and TV shows you like as your own checkbox/radio button values. At least 4 each, but you can use more. </p>
<p>The miniproject-script.php has specific instructions about what you should do with your scripts. Follow the instructions. You'll write a series of scripts, but you only need to create variables for the form data once; the variables can be reused in multiple scripts as long as their value isn't re-assigned.</p>
<p>Test your scripts by checking off different numbers of boxes: do it with none checked, with all checked and with some checked. That is what your conditional statement is looking for, and I'll test your script by doing the same thing.</p>

 <h3>Hints</h3>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Conditional Statement notes, exercise and powerpoint can help you with this.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Loop notes, exercise and powerpoint can help you with this.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Checkbox notes, exercise and powerpoint can help you with this.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Due Date</h3>
<p><strong>This mini-project is due by 8:00 pm on Sunday 9 March.</strong> To submit your completed mini-project, you must upload it to your own host, and then post the URL to the <strong>form</strong> (not the script) in the comments of the correct dropbox on our class D2L site. Remember that you must submit a file to the dropbox to enable the comments, so upload a dummy text file or word file. I will not download that file; I will use the link that you post in the comments to view your site.</p> 
<p>Be sure that you upload all the site files (ie: upload the entire root folder for the mini-project). Check your url to be sure it works. If your url does NOT work, I cannot score your project and I will deduct 1 point for a broken URL. Be sure you post the URL of the <strong>form</strong> because that is what I have to fill out to run your script :-) Of course, you have to upload both the form and the script.</p>

<h3>Scoring Forms Mini-Project</h3>
<p>Your score for this Mini-Project will be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">turned in correctly, on time, with functioning link = 1 pt max</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Form markup and content = 3 pts max</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Form markup and CSS validate = 1 pt max</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Form styles = 3 pts max</li>
